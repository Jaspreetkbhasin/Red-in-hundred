# Red-in-hundred
There’s a thing that I have realized with time, we’re humans and our brains can’t remember everything it comes across but it certainly does remember the changes we come across in our lives maybe because change is the only constant. When I was eight my dad told me the word “ hundred” consists of the word “red” so whenever I tried to figure out the spelling of hundred I knew it would end with “red”. But it was only after my dad discovered the red in hundred that I found out just three letters could possibly solve all my problems. U all know the meaning of 'RED'? Some probably not and we all have possibly spent more hours judging others rather than letting a person breathe in comfort. We all have spent so much time proving that we are right that we possibly ignored someone crying in the dark. And, here I am not talking to the ones who Judge. I am talking to ones who have spent their lives thinking they went wrong somewhere. And even the judging ones have had times they thought the same.” Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us”, didn’t know my school prayer had so much to tell me. The red in hundred
